# Identification-of-Ap-Candidates
Welcome! Here we provide the ECACNet code (PyTorch format) and the validation set list for the seven stellar classes.
# ECACNet.py
This repository contains the core network of ECACNet, which is implemented in PyTorch and designed for classifying Ap stars and six other stellar types. For training purposes, you may need to add specific parameters during the training process, such as the optimizer, learning rate, and others.
